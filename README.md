## Introduction
[summary]: #summary

Stronghold is a secure software implementation with the sole purpose of isolating digital secrets from exposure to hackers and accidental leaks. It uses versioned snapshots with double-encryption that can be easily backed up and securely shared between devices. Written in stable rust, it has strong guarantees of memory safety and process integrity. The high-level developer-friendly libraries integrate the IOTA protocol and serve as a reference implementation for anyone looking for inspiration or best-in-class tooling.

## Project Status
- Low-level libraries (beta quality)
- High-level libraries (under development)
- FFI Bindings (to-do)
- Rust Actor Wrapper (to-do)
