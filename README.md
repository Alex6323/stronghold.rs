# stronghold [wip]

## Introduction
[summary]: #summary
Stronghold is a secure software implementation (often used in conjunction with - or existing purely on - specialist 
hardware) with the sole purpose of isolating the seed, private keys, personally identifiable information (PII) and policy 
records from exposure to the genuinely hostile environment of user devices.

It uses snapshotting, device signatures and internal mechanisms for threshold signature schemes that MAY be distributed 
across devices.
